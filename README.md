This is an application for reading Mastodon toots.

Mousetodon is in development stage for now, but it should already fulfill the most basic interactions with any Mastodon server you may expect from an android app.
As compared to the other available android apps, Mousetodon is certainly not as nice and visually attractive (because it's not a priority for me),
but it has other advantages depicted below.
Its most noticeable features, which makes it different from the other apps, are:

- **langage detection** and filtering: you may define one or several languages, and only the toots from these languages will be shown
Note that this requires *a lot of RAM*: if the app crashes when you activate this function, you certainly don't have enough RAM and you cannot
use it. But I plan in the near future to implement a lightweight version of this function.
- **multiple accounts/instances** support, with fast switching between them with one-click.
- Open-source and as independent from proprietary 3rd-party libraries (e.g., Google ones) as possible.

Target features not implement yet:

- Search in toots
- Various language advanced features (words clouds, clustering...) (I'm in NLP after all !)

Current limitations:

- Does not show reply-history of toots
- Does not show user details
- Does not allow (yet) to reblog (in progress... but you can boost !)
- Does not support content warnings, nor media uploads

## User guide

At the first connection, the app will pop up a window asking for a Mastodon instance (without the http:// prefix, so just type in something like *mastodon.social*),
your email and password on this instance.
You then see 3 buttons on the top left, respectively for showing your notifications, your home timeline and the federated public timeline.

The 4th button allow you to toot a message, and the 5th button gives you the option to switch to the next known instance.
Initially, you should only have defined a single instance, but you can later on easily add another one via the application menu (3 little dots at the bottom right on
"old" Android devices), item "+Account".
The two other items in the application menu are not fully functional for now and you don't need them.

Any timeline shows a list of toots, with a picture of the sender on the left, and some technical information on top
(the date, whether you have boosted this toot (with a star), the sender name).
At the bottom of the list, you have the option to download older toots.

If you click on any of these toots, a popup windows appears that shows all the medias and URLs links from the toot:
now, if you click on one of these media/URLs, it is opened with the appropriate Android application.
This popup window also gives you the option to reply to this toot, boost or unboost it.

## How to build

Contrary to other apps, building Mousetodon is very simple, because my objective is to be able
to build it even from within an android device itself !
So you don't need heavy IDE like Virtual Studio, nor even internet connections, as the few dependencies
are in git.
You just need the Java JDK, an Android SDK and the good old ANT build system (which I will soon complement
by a simple script).

After cloning, you can thus just type:
```
ant debug
```
and it should create the apk straight away.

## Why yet another android app for mastodon ?

There are already several android apps for mastodon. 
However, a number of them are not written in *native java*, which makes them too slow or even
incompatible on old devices.

The *Tusky* app is native, and is also one of the most advanced android client I've found;
it is also packed with lots of features, so I recommend you to try it out first, and if it
does not work fine for you, then you may come back here.
I actually don't like a few of Tusky features:

- Tusky relies on Google Firebase: this makes the app heavy to build, incompatible with old devices,
dependent on Google play services, and your data is not totally in your control.
From firebase site: "[Firebase] helps you quickly [...] earn more money.", 
"At the heart of Firebase is Firebase Analytics",
"Earn money by displaying engaging ads"... Is it really FOSS ?
- Tusky connects to a special server to allow for two-factor authentification; I consider it is a potential threat
for privacy, and the app will not work whenever this additional server is down or attacked.
So I really prefer to use simple login/password authentification, which also looks to work on all Mastodon instances afaik.

Because of these reasons, and also because Tusky do not implement some features that I really want,
I've decided to implement my own android client for mastodon.
The features that are not available on other apps and that I want to have are:

- language detection: a first version is already up and running, but it consumes too much RAM, so I want
to implement another lightweight version of it;
- multiple logins: when you have several accounts on several instances, it is convenient to be able to quickly
switch from one account to another;
- support for older devices (well, apart from the language detection feature); I would like to make an app that works
on an old 2.3.3 android;
- very simple compilation process, as few external dependencies as possible. I must be able to compile it on an
android smartphone (without any PC).
