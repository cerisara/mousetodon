This is an application for reading Mastodon toots.
It is in beta stage for now.

Its current features are:

- Email/password connection to a Mastodon instance
- Download and show timelines: Home, Notifications, Public
- Optional langage detection and filtering: you may define one or several languages, and only the toots from these languages will be shown
Note that this requires a lot of RAM: if the app crashes when you activate this function, you don't have enough RAM and you cannot
use it. But I plan in the near future to implement a lightweight version of this function.

Desired features:

- Search in toots
- Show public timelines of any instance without account
- Switch between several accounts easily
- Various language advanced features (words clouds, clustering...) (I'm an NLP researcher after all !)

Its current limitations:

- Does not show images / videos
- Does not allow to write a toot, reply, reblog nor favorize
